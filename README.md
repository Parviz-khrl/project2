## üìò Project Overview
This project implements **Huffman Coding**, a classic *Greedy Algorithm* that assigns optimal prefix-free binary codes to a set of symbols based on their frequencies.  

The algorithm ensures:
1. No code is the prefix of another (prefix-free property).  
2. The total weighted code length (frequency √ó code length) is minimized.  

This satisfies the project specification:

> **Option 9:**  
> Given a set of symbols and their frequency of usage, find a binary code for each symbol such that:  
> (a) Binary code for any symbol is not the prefix of another.  
> (b) The weighted length of codes for all symbols (weighted by their usage frequency) is minimized.

## üß© Implementation Summary
The implementation follows the standard **O(n log n)** Huffman algorithm using a Min-Priority Queue.

- **Phase 1:** Construct a min-heap (priority queue) from all input symbols and their frequencies.  
- **Phase 2:** Iteratively extract the two smallest nodes, merge them, and reinsert their combined frequency until one root remains.  
- **Phase 3:** Recursively traverse the final tree to assign binary codes (0 for left, 1 for right).

The implementation automatically satisfies both prefix-free and minimum-weight properties through the greedy merge process.

## üß† Theoretical Basis
The pseudocode structure is adapted from the algorithmic description in the *Wikipedia article on Huffman Coding* (as recommended by Professor Aurora in Lecture 5 slides):
> [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)

Time complexity was analyzed theoretically as:
\[
T(n) = O(n \log n)
\]
due to repeated `extractMin()` and `insert()` heap operations on \( n \) symbols.
